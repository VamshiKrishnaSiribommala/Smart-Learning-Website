Our Educational Website provides all the education-related stuff:
Notes, Sample Papers, Online Video Lectures, and Courses to crack competitive
exams like JEE-Main, JEE-Advanced, GATE, etc. Students can clear their doubts
by sending their questions through the website. We’ve added Quizzes for students
who are willing to solve problems on different topics. We’ve also added
Interview Questions for students who are preparing for placements.

✔ We have made this a responsive website, so students or users can
easily access it from any device.  
✔ **Quiz Section** is an interesting feature that provides lots of questions. Students can view their scores and see solutions for each question.  
✔ **Projects Section** – We have added a project section where school and
college students can explore projects for their final year or Class 12th Boards.

It is a completely responsive website to provide a smooth experience... 😎
